# Code Review

We review code before it is merged to ensure that code is maintainable and usable by someone other than the author.

- Is the code well commented, structured for clarity, and consistent with DM’s code style?
- Is there adequate unit test coverage for the code?
- Is the documentation augmented or updated to be consistent with the code changes?
- Are the Git commits well organized and well annotated to help future developers understand the code development?

Code reviews should also address whether the code fulfills design and performance requirements.

Ideally the code review should not be a design review. Before serious coding effort is committed to a ticket, the developer should either undertake an informal design review while creating the design.

Code review discussion should happen on the GitHub pull request, with the reviewer giving a discussion summary.

Pull request conversations should only happen in ‘Conversation’ and ‘Files changed’ tabs; your comments might get lost otherwise.

Code reviews are a collaborative check-and-improve process. Reviewers do not hold absolute authority, nor can developers ignore the reviewer’s suggestions. The aim is to discuss, iterate, and improve the pull request until the work is ready to be deployed on master.

If the review becomes stuck on a design decision, that aspect of the review can be elevated to seek team-wide consensus.
